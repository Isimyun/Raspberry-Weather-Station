# Raspberry Pi Weather Station
A weather station project using a Raspberry Pi, a DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity, and a barometric sensor to gather atmospheric pressure data. 
This project provides real-time weather data, logs it, and can display trends over time.

## Features
- Temperature Monitoring: Real-time temperature data from the DHT11 sensor.
- Humidity Monitoring: Real-time humidity data from the DHT11 sensor.
- Atmospheric Pressure: Real-time barometric pressure readings from the BMP180 sensor.
- Data Logging: Logs data at regular intervals to track weather patterns.
- Data Visualization: Uses PHP libraries to display logged data graphically.

## Components
- Raspberry Pi: Acts as the main controller and processes sensor data.
- DHT11 Sensor: Measures temperature and humidity.
- BMP180 Sensor: Measures atmospheric pressure.

## Prerequisites
- Raspberry Pi (any model)
- DHT11 Sensor
- BMP180 Sensor
- Python 3 with necessary libraries

## Setup Instructions
#### You can read the detailed instructions in the report

## Future improvements
- Data Storage: Store data in a database for long-term analysis.
- Additional Sensors: Add more sensors for wind speed, rain detection, etc.
- Cloud Integration: Send data to the cloud for remote monitoring.
